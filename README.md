# Learning Akka
This is the example code for the lessons from the Video Course [Learning Akka](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-akka/9781784391836/) by Salma Khater.

## Introduction
[Akka](http://akka.io/) is an open-source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the JVM. Akka supports multiple programming models for concurrency, but it emphasizes actor-based concurrency, with inspiration drawn from Erlang. Language bindings exist for both Java and Scala.

This course suppose to provide the foundation in Akka that will enable to develop excellent applications and services with this toolkit.

In the README files to my examples I will discuss the issues, which I found important but which are not mentioned in the videos.
